                <p>
                  Sidecar racing features machines with purpose built chassis,
                  which owe more in design to open wheel car racing than
                  motorcycle racing. Piloted by a driver and a passenger, the TT
                  sidecars are powered by 600cc 4-cylinder, 675cc 3-cylinder,
                  and 900cc parallel-twin engines.
                </p>
                <h5>Jack and Vicky's Sidecar</h5>
                <p>
                  Piloted by a driver and a passenger, the TT sidecars are
                  powered by 600cc 4-cylinder, 675cc 3-cylinder, and 900cc
                  parallel-twin engines. The driver is positioned kneeling
                  behind the engine with hands near the front wheel, while the
                  passenger moves about the platform at the rear transferring
                  their weight from left to right according to the corner and
                  forward or back to gain traction for the front or rear. The
                  passenger also helps the driver when it comes to drifting. The
                  two must work together to be a successful team.
